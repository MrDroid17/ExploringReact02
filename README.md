# Two types of Export/Import

- Default Export/Import

export default Component;
import Component from "path";

- Named Export/Import

export const Component;
import {Component} from "path";


# React Hooks
 (Normal JS utility functions)
- useState() - Superpowerful State Variables in react
    ```jsx
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    ```
    
- useEffect() - it will be call post the respective component is rendered
  - Uses 2 argument, 
    - 1.  Callback function 
    - 2. Dependency array -> 
        - If no dependency array provided --> use Effect will be called on post every render of useEffect
    ```jsx
        useEffect(() => {
                    console.log('Component mounted');
                  }, []);
    ```
  ## Reconciliation algorithm (React Fiber)
  - Uses virtual DOM - representaion of actual DOM - react-16
  - Diff algorithm - finds the diff of two virtual DOM(updated and previous virtual DOM)
  - [React fiber Architecture](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture)

  ## Monolith and Micro Service Architecture:
    - Micro Service - Seperation of concern and Single responsibility principle.

  ## 2 ways to render data
    - **First** - Loads the page ----> api call ----> Render UI
    - **Second** - Loads the Page ----> render ui with whatever data you have ----> api call ---> re render api( *React prefer this approach*)
 


#  2 types Routing in web apps
 - Client Side Routing
 - Server Side Routing

#  Higher order component
  - A **Higher-Order Component (HOC)** in React is a pattern used to reuse component logic. It is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new enhanced component.
  -  This is useful for tasks like:
     -   applying authentication, 
     -   adding styling, 
     -   or reusing common functionality across multiple components.
  
  - **Disadvantages**
    - Can lead to "Wrapper Hell" (deeply nested components).
    - Debugging is harder due to the abstraction.
    - Not as flexible as React Hooks for some use cases.  
  - **Key Points**
    - **Props Forwarding**: Always forward props to the wrapped component using **{...props}** to ensure it has access to its original props.
    - **Static Methods**: Static methods on the original component are not automatically copied to the HOC. Use the **hoist-non-react-statics** package if needed:
  ```jsx
      const withEnhancement = (WrappedComponent) => {
        return (props) => {
          // Add custom logic or props here
          return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
        };
      };
  ```

#  Controlled Component

  A controlled component in React is an input element (e.g., ```<input>, <textarea>, <select>```) whose value is controlled by React state. React manages the component's state, and any changes are propagated via event handlers.

  - Key Features
    - React controls the form elementâ€™s value using the value attribute.
    - The component always reflects the latest state value.
    - Useful for form validation and dynamic input handling.
```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    const ControlledComponent = () => {
        const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
        const handleChange = (event) => {
            setInputValue(event.target.value); // Update state
        };

        return (
            <div>
                <input 
                    type="text" 
                    value={inputValue} // Controlled by state
                    onChange={handleChange} // Updates state on change
                />
                <p>Input Value: {inputValue}</p>
            </div>
        );
    };
    export default ControlledComponent;
```

#  Lifting State Up
  Lifting state up is a technique used to share state between multiple components by moving the state to their closest common ancestor. This allows sibling components to communicate and share the same state.

  - Why Lift State Up?
    - To centralize state management.
    - To make data flow consistent in a parent-child hierarchy.
    - To enable communication between sibling components.
  ```jsx
      /**
      * RestaurantCategory is controlled componnet
      * Lifting state up - showList is maintened in parent(RestaurantMenu) component instead of RestaurantCategory itself
      */
  ```
# Props Drilling in React
  - React has one way data flow ( parent --> child ---> grand child ----> great grand child and so on.)
  - **Props drilling** refers to the process of passing data from a parent component to deeply nested child components through intermediate components, even if those intermediate components donâ€™t need the data themselves. This often happens when the data or functionality needs to be used by components several levels deep in the component hierarchy.
  
  - ### Problems with Props Drilling:
    - **Redundancy**: Intermediate components pass props unnecessarily, even when they donâ€™t use them.
    - **Tight Coupling**: Changes in the data structure or components require updates throughout the chain.
    - **Code Complexity**: For deep hierarchies, props drilling makes the code harder to read and maintain.
  - ### Solutions to Avoid Props Drilling
  1. **Context API**
    The React Context API provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props at every level.
    - How it works:
      - The **UserContext.Provider** wraps the component tree, providing the user value.
      The *GrandChild* uses **useContext(UserContext)** to access the data directly, avoiding intermediate props passing.
  2. **State Management Libraries (Redux, MobX, Zustand)**
    State management libraries like Redux or Zustand provide centralized stores for managing and accessing state.
    - Redux Example:
      - Store the **user** data in a global Redux store.
      - Access it in any component using **useSelector**.
  3. **Component Composition**
    If feasible, restructure your components to avoid deep hierarchies or nest only the necessary parts.

 # Redux Toolkit
    Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic in React. It simplifies state management by reducing boilerplate code and improving developer experience.
     **React Toolkit uses Immerjs behind the scene** 
     **ImmerJS** : Immer (German for: always) is a tiny package that allows you to work with immutable state in a more convenient way.

  **Steps:**
  - Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
  - Create a Redux Slice(logical seperation of redux store)
      - A slice contains the state, reducers (logic to modify state), and actions in one file.    
  - Build our store
  - Provide Store to React
  - Use Redux State in a Component
  
  - ðŸŽ¯ **Why Use Redux Toolkit?**
      - âœ… Less Boilerplate - No need for manual action types & reducers.
      - âœ… Better Performance - Uses Immer for state updates.
      - âœ… Built-in Middleware - Async handling with createAsyncThunk.
      - âœ… Scalability - Clean modular structure.



# Types of testing (developer)
 - Unit Testing - test your react component/unit in isolation of the app
 - Integration Testing - multiple components are involve
 - End to End Testing - e2e testing - testing the entire flow

# Setting up Testing in our app
 - Install React Testing Library uses jest under the hood
 - Installed jest
 - Installed Babel dependencies
 - Configure Babel 
 - Configure Parcel Config file to disable default babel transpilation 
 - Jest  - npx jest --init
 - Install jsdom library
 - Install @babel/preset-react - to make JSX work in test cases
 - Include @babel/preset-react inside my babel config
 - npm i -D @testing-library/jest-dom
